Overview:
In this programming challenge we encourage candidates to match the minimal application functionality. However, feel free to add functionality with an explanation in the email of your final product.
 
The Problem:
A client has requested a web application that calls an API-enabled backend utilizing an algorithm.  The backend algorithm takes in 2 integers representing a range, and converts each number in the range. Multiples of 7 convert to “MS3”, multiples of 3 convert to “ME”, and multiples of both 7 and 3 convert to “MS3 and ME”.  The algorithm should be created in the most optimized way possible. The input range has a limit from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 200. Ideally, users should be able to query inputs from either web UI or HTTP API calls.  Responses should be in the form of JSON and an HTML representation.
 
What we are looking for:
Code should be submitted via email with a link to a github or bitbucket repository
You can utilize either Java and/or Mulesoft to accomplish this task
Any special instructions for running the application(s) should be listed in the email
Front end web application

Backend API 
API that exposes the algorithm defined in the problem statement
HTML should have 2 integer input fields
HTML should have a submit button
HTML should have a table that represents the numeric key/value pairing
HTML print out of JSON response


Bonus Requirements
Add a button for reversing the output
Submitting a link to a deployed application on cloudhub with instruction
